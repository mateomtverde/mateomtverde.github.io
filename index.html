    <h1>Matthew Green</h1>
    <h2>Major: Computer Applications</h2>
    <p>My goal for this course is to learn as much as possible from it. I would like to be able to understand and utilize all of the coding correctly and proficiently.
         I am prepared to make mistakes and learn from them.</p>
    <p>Once I finish my degree at Texas Tech, I would like to take everything that I have learned into my future career. 
        I am looking forward to landing a job in web development or software development. No matter what the future holds I will take everything that I have 
        learned from school and previous jobs with me.</p>
